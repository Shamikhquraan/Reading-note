## Readings : Audio, Video, Images:

+ ### Controlling size of images in CSS.
+ ### Aligning images in CSS.
+ ### Adding background images.


**Controlling** the size and alignment of your images using CSS keeps rules that
affect the presentation of your page in the CSS and out of the HTML markup.
You can also achieve several interesting effects using
background images. In this chapter you will learn how to:

+ Specify the size and alignment of an image using.
+ Add background images to boxes.
+  Create image rollovers in CSS.

### AligNing images :

+ The float property is added to the class that was created to
represent the size of the image.

### Background Images

The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML
element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page.

Background images are often the last thing on the page to
load (which can make a website seem slow to load). As with any

### images you use online, if the size of the file is large it will take
longer to download.


### Repeating Images background-repeat background-attachment:
### repeat:
+ The background image is repeated both horizontally and vertically
 (the default way it is shown if the backgroundrepeat property isn't used).

 ### fixed : The background image stays in
the same position on the page scroll.

+ The background image moves up and down as the user scrolls
up and down the page.

### Background Position background-position:
When an image is not being repeated, you can use the
background-position

+ property to specify where in the browser window the background
image should be placed.

+ This property usually has a pair of values. The first represents
the horizontal position and the second represents the vertical.

### some property for background :

+ left top
 + left center
 + left bottom
 + center top
 + center center
 + center bottom
+ right top
 + right center
 + right bottom

### Shorthand background :

The background property acts like a shorthand for all of the
other background properties you have just seen, and also the
background-color property.

The properties must be specified in the following order, but you
can miss any value if you do not want to specify it:

+ 1: background-color
+ 2: background-image
+ 3: background-repeat
+ 4: background-attachment
+ 5: background-position

## Image Rollovers , & Sprites :

### Summary

### IMAGES:

+ You can specify the dimensions of images using CSS.
This is very helpful when you use the same sized
images on several pages of your site.

+ Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically
using CSS.

+  You can use a background image behind the box
created by any element on a page.

+ Background images can appear just once or be
repeated across the background of the box.

+ You can create image rollover effects by moving the
background position of an image.

+ To reduce the number of images your browser has to
load, you can create image sprites.



## Grouping and Similarity:

+ **When making sense of a design,** we tend to organize visual elements
into groups. Grouping related pieces of information together can make a
design easier to comprehend. Here are some ways this can be achieved.

### Proximity:
+ When several items are placed close together, they are
perceived as more related than items that are placed further
apart. (You can also nest groups of information within larger
groups of information.)

### Closure:

+ When faced with a complicated arrangement of items, we
will often look for a single or
recognisable pattern or form.
A real or imaginary box can be
formed around elements due to
their proximity and alignment.

### Continuance, color,Borders and White Space .

### Designing Navigation:

+ CONCISE

+ CLEAR

+ SELECTIVE

### Context:
Good navigation provides context. It lets the user know
where they are in the website at that moment. Using a different
color or some kind of visual marker to indicate the current
page is a good way to do this.

### Interactive:

Each link should be big enough to click on and the appearance
of the link should change when the user hovers over each item
or clicks on it. It should also be visually distinct from other
content on the page.

### Consistent: 

The more pages a site contains, the larger the number of
navigation items there will be.
Although secondary navigation will change from page to page,
it is best to keep the primary navigation exactly the same.


### Summary

+ PROCESS & Design :

+ You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.

+ You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.


### Practical Information :

+ Search engine optimization.

+ Using analytics to understand visitors.

+ Putting your site on the web.


## Search Engine Optimization (SEO) :

### The Basics
Search engine optimization (orSEO) is the practice of trying to help your site appear 
nearer the top of search engine results when people look for the topicsthat your website
 covers.


### On-Page Techniques
On-page techniques are the methods you can use on your
web pages to improve their rating in search engines.


### Off-Page Techniques
Getting other sites to link to you is just as important as on-page
techniques. Search engines help determine how to rank your site by looking
 at the number of other sites that link to yours.

 ### 1: Page Title
The page title appears at the top of the browser window or on the
tab of a browser. It is specified in the <title> element which lives
inside the <head> element.


### 2: URL / Web Address
The name of the file is part of the URL. Where possible, use
keywords in the file name.


### 3: Headings
If the keywords are in a heading <hn> element then a search
engine will know that this page is all about that subject and give it
greater weight than other text.

### 4: Text
Where possible, it helps to repeat the keywords in the main
body of the text at least 2-3 times. Do not, however, over-use
these terms, because the text must be easy for a human to
read.

### 5: Link Text
Use keywords in the text that create links between pages
(rather than using generic expressions such as "click here").

### 6: Image Alt Text
Search engines rely on you providing accurate descriptions
of images in the alt text. 
This will also help your images show up in the results of image-based
searches.

### 7: Page Descriptions

The description also lives inside the <head> element and is
specified using a <meta> tag. It should be a sentence that
describes the content of the page. (These are not shown in
the browser window but they may be displayed in the results
pages of search engines.)

to have a good webpage resarch :
+ Brainstorm
+ Organize
+ Research
+ Compare
+ Refine
+ Map


### Analytics: Learning about your Visitors:

As soon as people start coming to your site, you can start analyzing
how they found it, what they were looking at and at what point they are
leaving. One of the best tools for doing this is a free service offered by
Google called **Google Analytics.**

### Signing Up
The Google Analytics service relies on you signing up for an
account at:
www.google.com/analytics The site will give you a piece of
tracking code which you need to put on every page of your site.

### How it Works 
Every time someone loads a page of your site, the tracking
code sends data to the Google servers where it is stored.Google 
then provides a webbased interface that allows you
to see how visitors use your site.

### The Tracking Code
A tracking code is provided by Google Analytics for each
website you are tracking. It should appear just before the
closing </head> tag. The code does not alter the appearance of
your web pages.


### How Many People Are Coming to Your Site?
The overview page gives you a snapshot of the key information you are
likely to want to know. In particular, it tells you how many people are
coming to your site.
