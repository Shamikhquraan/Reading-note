### Lists:

+ ordered lists
+ Unordered lists

**The ordered list** is created with the ol element.
Each item in the list is placed between an opening li tag and a closing li

**The unordered** list is created
with the ul element.
and the same Each item in the list is placed between an opening li tag and a closing li

**Definition Lists**
definition list is created with the dl element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions.
dt This is used to contain the trm being defined

dd This is used to contain the definition.

By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents. To set your own dimensions for a box you can use the height and width properties.

When we use percentages, the size of the box is relative to the size of the browser window or, if the box is encased within another box, it is a percentage of the size of the containing box.


### Overflowing Content:

1. **overflow**
2. **hidden**
3. **scroll**


### border-style
+ we can control the style of a border using the border-style property.

###border-color
+ we can specify the color of a border using either RGB values, hex codes or CSS color names

### Padding
+ we can specify how much space should appear between the content of an element and its border.

### Margin
+ The margin property controls the gap between boxes. Its value is commonly given in pixels.

### Centering Content
+ In order to center a box on the page, you need to set a width for the box, Once you have specified the width of the box, setting the left and right margins to auto will make the browser put an equal gap on each side of the box

### Change Inline/Block
+ display
+ inline
+ inline-block
and about there is ***none***

CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box. and You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box. also You can also control the borders, margin and padding for each box with CSS.

### CREATING AN ARRAY

![js](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/Array-In-C.png)

+ Arrays are especially helpful when we do not know how many items a list will contain because, when you create the array, you do not need to specify how many values it will hold.

**EXPRESSIONS**
-An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.

***USING IF … ELSE STATEMENTS***
if … else statement allows you to provide two sets of code:
one set if the condition evaluates to true and another set if the condition is false.

### SWITCH STATEMENTS:
![js](https://www.udacity.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-22-at-4.32.49-PM.png)

A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.

### SHORT CIRCUIT VALUES
Logical operators are processed left to right. They short-circuit (stop) as soon as they have a result - but they return the value that stopped the processing (not necessarily true or false

### Loops
loops check a condition if it return true the code block will run, then the condition will be checked again ,it repeat until the condition return false.

### USING FOR LOOPS
A for loop is often used to loop through the items in an array.

### USING WHILE LOOPS
This loop will continue to run for as long as the condition in the parentheses is true.

### USING DO WHILE LOOPS
The key difference between a whi 1 e loop and a do whi 1 e loop is that the statements in the code block come before the condition. This means that those statements are run once whether or not the condition is met..
