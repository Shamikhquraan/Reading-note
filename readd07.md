### Don't repeat yourself :
**DOnt repeate the codes** that u can minmize and make the code more dynamic .

also **Alternatives**:
* **WET** Write Everything Twice (WET) is a cheeky abbreviation to mean the opposite i.e. code that doesn't adhere to DRY principle. It is quite obvious which one of the two should all developers be aiming for. some of advantages of WET: it maintainability , readability and coast and alot of things.

* **AHA** AHA is rooted in the understanding that the deeper the investment we've made into abstracting a piece of software, the more we perceive that the cost of that investment can never be recovered (Sunk cost fallacy).


## Rule of three (Duplication):
* **Is a code refactoring** rule of thumb to decide when a replicated piece of code should be replaced by a new procedure. It states that you are allowed to copy and paste the code once, but that when the same code is replicated three times, it should be extracted into a new procedure.


## Yagni (you aren't gonna need it):

**Yagni originally** is an acronym that stands for "You Aren't Gonna Need It". It is a mantra from ExtremeProgramming that's often used generally in agile software teams. It's a statement that some capability we presume our software needs in the future should not be built now because "you aren't gonna need it".

## A minimum viable product (MVP):
**A minimum viable product, or MVP,** is a product with enough features to attract early-adopter customers and validate a product idea early in the product development cycle. In industries such as software, the MVP can help the product team receive user feedback as quickly as possible to iterate and improve the product.
