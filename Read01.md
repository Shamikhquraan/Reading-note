### and create sophisticated formatting for your prose and code on GitHub with simple syntax for example :
- **Headings :** " # " if u put this before a word it will be the largest heading .
                 " ## " if u put before a word it will be the second heading .
- **Styling text :** You can indicate emphasis with bold, italic, or strikethrough text in comment fields for example : " ** "  ---> " ** " **This is blod text** .

- **also** add picture by using this code ---> **! [] ()** with out space between them  , between the [] some worde related to picture and between the () linke the picture or name it if uploded to the file .
