### This keyword ! The keyword this is commonly used inside functions and objects. Where the function is declared alters what this means. It always refers to one object, usually the object in which the function operates.

**A FUNCTION IN GLOBAL SCOPE :** When a function is created at the top level of a script (that is, not inside another object or function), then it is in the global scope or global context.

**GLOBAL VARIABLES All global variables**  also become properties of the window object. so when a function is in the global context, you can access global variables using the window object, as well as its other properties.
+ In JavaScript, data is represented using name/value pairs.

+ To organize your data, you can use an array or object to group a set of related values. In arrays and objects the name is also known as a key.

**VARIABLES :** A variable has just one key (the variable name) and one value.

**ARRAYS Arrays :** can store multiple pieces of information. Each piece of information is separated by a comma. The order of the values is important because items in an array are assigned a number (called an index). Values in an array are put in square brackets, separated by commas.

### WHAT ARE BUILT-IN OBJECTS?
Browsers come with a set of built-in objects that represent things like the browser window and the current web page shown in that window. These built-in objects act like a toolkit for creating interactive web pages. The objects you create will usually be specifically written to suit your needs. They model the data used within, or contain functionality needed by, your script. Whereas, the built-in objects contain functionality.

### GLOBAL OBJECTS:
