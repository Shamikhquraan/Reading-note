+ **People** with a fixed mindset believe talent is everything. If they’re not gifted with the ability to do something, they think they’re doomed to be a failure. Their skills seem to be written down in their genes, just like their looks, which is why they never try to improve in something they suck at.

  To contrast that, people with a growth mindset believe that whatever they want to achieve is theirs for the taking, as long as they work hard for it, *dedicate* themselves to their goal and practice as much as they can.

  + **Since** our mindset has a big influence on our performance, both are worth taking a closer look at.
