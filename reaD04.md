+ Links are found in nearly all web pages. Links allow users to click their way from page to page.

HTML links are hyperlinks.
You can click on a link and jump to another document.
When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

### HTML Links - Hyperlinks

You can click on a link and jump to another document.

When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

HTML Links - The target Attribute
By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link.

The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.

The target attribute can have one of the following values:

+ self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked.
+ blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab.
+ parent - Opens the document in the parent frame.
+ top - Opens the document in the full body of the window.

### Linking to Other Pages on the Same Site:

When you are linking to other pages within the same site, you do not need to specify the domain name in the URL. You can use a shorthand known as a relative URL.

### Relative URLs:

Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to find your files.

### Email Links:

To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address, you use the a element.

### Opening Links ina New Window :

If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the target attribute on the opening a tag. The value of this attribute should be _blank.

### Linking to a Specific Part of the Same Page:
To link to an element that uses an id attribute you use the a element again, but the value of the href attribute starts with the # symbol, followed by the value of the id attribute of the element you want to link to.

### Layout :
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.

### Containing Elements:
If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element

### Floating Elements:

The float property allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible. The **blockquote** element is floated to the right, and the paragraphs that follow the quote flow around the floated element.

### clear :
+ left * Right * both * none

### Screen Sizes:
Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.

### Screen Resolution:
Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.

### Page Sizes:
Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide (since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens)

### Pair programming:
Iterative loops. Code reviews. Fast feedback. Error checking and linting. These are software engineering practices that have proven to dramatically improve the quality of code developers produce.
While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard.
