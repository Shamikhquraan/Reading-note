## summary Htmll :

+ **we** talking about httml and what we can do throw it ,create HTML documents at riplet made our coading as we will change and add it at github throw local storage (shell) using ACP . 

  ** HTML ** describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document .

 ** HTML ** element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">".  The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive.
 ** That ** is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the <title> tag can be written as <Title>, <TITLE>, or in any other way.
  
  + **syntax** we use it at httml : 
 -
   like **Semantics** in HTML
In HTML, for example, the <h1> element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."

- **Key** resources  , and alot of syntax had written in how to make tables by < ul> , < li> .. and link words to website link.
