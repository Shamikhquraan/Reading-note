## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team:

![](Google.jpg)

- **The** main thing that i learned from Google **‘As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well. But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.’**



**If you are given** a choice between serious-minded Team or the free-flowing , you should probably opt for Team free-flowing. Team serious-minded may be filled with smart people, all optimized for peak individual efficiency. 


**But the** group’s norms discourage equal speaking; there are few exchanges of the kind of personal information that lets teammates pick up on what people are feeling or leaving unsaid.


**There’s** a good chance the members of the first tem will continue to act like individuals once they come together, and there’s little to suggest that, as a group, they will become more collectively intelligent.


### We had lots of data, but there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference. The ‘‘who’’ part of the equation didn’t seem to matter.’

### Who is Roy Fielding?


- **He is** a guy who helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does.



### Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?


- **Because** the large majority of developers were busy writing layers of complex specifications for how to access data in a different way that isn't nearly as useful or eloquent, known as SOAP.




### What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?


- **HTTP** is a protocol it's capable of all sorts of neat stuff that people ignore for some reason. It is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web.


### What does a GET do? 

- **Retrieve** information from other servers.

### What does a POST do? 

- **If** one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST.



### What does PUT do? 

- **If** a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT.


### What does PATCH do?

 - **If** a system wants to to do a partial update in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PATCH.




### Yes i have from at least 2 website that provide free AIP adress for us .
