## Code of Ethics :

- Computing professionals' actions change the world. To act responsibly, they should reflect upon the wider impacts of their work, consistently supporting the public good. The ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct (**"the Code"**) expresses the conscience of the profession.

- The Code is designed to inspire and guide the ethical conduct of all computing professionals, including current and aspiring practitioners, instructors, students, influencers, and anyone who uses computing technology in an impactful way. Additionally, the Code serves as a basis for remediation when violations occur. The Code includes principles formulated as statements of responsibility, based on the understanding that the public good is always the primary consideration. Each principle is supplemented by guidelines, which provide explanations to assist computing professionals in understanding and applying the principle.

5. Microsoft AI Principles
- **We put our** responsible AI principles into practice through the Office of Responsible AI (ORA), the AI, Ethics, and Effects in Engineering and Research (Aether) Committee, and Responsible AI Strategy in Engineering (RAISE). The Aether Committee advises our leadership on the challenges and opportunities presented by AI innovations. ORA sets our rules and governance processes, working closely with teams across the company to enable the effort. RAISE is a team that enables the implementation of Microsoft responsible AI rules across engineering groups.

 ### Ethical OS Toolkit
- As technologists, it’s only natural that we spend most of our time focusing on how our tech will change the world for the better. Which is great. Everyone loves a sunny disposition. But perhaps it’s more useful, in some ways, to consider the glass half empty. What if, in addition to fantasizing about how our tech will save the world, we spent some time dreading all the ways it might, possibly, perhaps, just maybe, screw everything up? No one can predict exactly what tomorrow will bring (though somewhere in the tech world, someone is no doubt working on it). So until we get that crystal ball app, the best we can hope to do is anticipate the long-term social impact and unexpected uses of the tech we create today.

### Principle 1: PUBLIC
Accept full responsibility for their own work.
Moderate the interests of the software engineer, the employer, the client and the users with the public good.
- Approve software only if they have a well-founded belief that it is safe, meets specifications, passes appropriate tests, and does not diminish quality of life, diminish privacy or harm the environment. The ultimate effect of the work should be to the public good.
- Disclose to appropriate persons or authorities any actual or potential danger to the user, the public, or the environment, that they reasonably believe to be associated with software or related documents.
- Cooperate in efforts to address matters of grave public concern caused by software, its installation, maintenance, support or documentation.
- Be fair and avoid deception in all statements, particularly public ones, concerning software or related documents, methods and tools.

- Keep private any confidential information gained in their professional work, where such confidentiality is consistent with the public interest and consistent with the law.
- Identify, document, collect evidence and report to the client or the employer promptly if, in their opinion, a project is likely to fail, to prove too expensive, to violate intellectual property law, or otherwise to be problematic.
- Identify, document, and report significant issues of social concern, of which they are aware, in software or related documents, to the employer or the client.
- Accept no outside work detrimental to the work they perform for their primary employer.
- Promote no interest adverse to their employer or client, unless a higher ethical concern is being compromised; in that case, inform the employer or another appropriate authority of the ethical concern.

### Principle 3: PRODUCT

- Identify, define and address ethical, economic, cultural, legal and environmental issues related to work projects.
Ensure that they are qualified for any project on which they work or propose to work by an appropriate combination of education and training, and experience.
- Ensure an appropriate method is used for any project on which they work or propose to work.
- Work to follow professional standards, when available, that are most appropriate for the task at hand, departing from these only when ethically or technically justified.

- Work to develop software and related documents that respect the privacy of those who will be affected by that software.
- Be careful to use only accurate data derived by ethical and lawful means, and use it only in ways properly authorized.
- Maintain the integrity of data, being sensitive to outdated or flawed occurrences.
- Treat all forms of software maintenance with the same professionalism as new development.

### Principle 4: JUDGMENT
1. Temper all technical judgments by the need to support and maintain human values.
2. Only endorse documents either prepared under their supervision or within their areas of competence and with which they are in agreement.
3. Maintain professional objectivity with respect to any software or related documents they are asked to evaluate.
4. Not engage in deceptive financial practices such as bribery, double billing, or other improper financial practices.
5. Disclose to all concerned parties those conflicts of interest that cannot reasonably be avoided or escaped.
6. Refuse to participate, as members or advisors, in a private, governmental or professional body concerned with software related issues, in which they, their employers or their clients have undisclosed potential conflicts of interest.

### The Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice
- Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice (Version 5.2) as recommended by the ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Task Force on Software Engineering Ethics and Professional Practices and jointly approved by the ACM and the IEEE-CS as the standard for teaching and practicing software engineering.

- Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice (Short Version) PREAMBLE The short version of the code summarizes aspirations at a high level of the abstraction; the clauses that are included in the full version give examples and details of how these aspirations change the way we act as software engineering professionals. Without the aspirations, the details can become legalistic and tedious; without the details, the aspirations can become high sounding but empty; together, the aspirations and the details form a cohesive code.

- Software engineers shall commit themselves to making the analysis, specification, design, development, testing and maintenance of software a beneficial and respected profession. In accordance with their commitment to the health, safety and welfare of the public,

### software engineers shall adhere to the following Eight Principles:
* PUBLIC – Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.
* CLIENT AND EMPLOYER – Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their client and employer consistent with the public interest.
* PRODUCT – Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.
* JUDGMENT – Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment.
* MANAGEMENT – Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance.
