- * first about some summary as a points :

+ **HTML** pages are text documents.
+ **HTML** uses tags (  characters that sit inside angled
brackets * ) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
+ **Tags are** often referred to as elements.
+ **Tags usually** come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
+ **Opening tags** can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.
+ **Attributes** require a name and a value.
+ **To learn** HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go.


**we** talking about httml and what we can do throw it ,create HTML documents at **VS code** by  made our coading as we will change and add it at github throw local storage using ACP , ** HTML ** describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document .

 ** HTML ** element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">".  The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive.
 ** That ** is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the <title> tag can be written as <Title>, <TITLE>, or in any other way.
  
  + **syntax** we use it at httml : 
 -
   like **Semantics** in HTML
In HTML, for example, the <h1> element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."

+ **now** let me speake like teaching a102 student that i will walk through an example as though me were teaching :

## HTML Comments tags:
 
+ **You** can add comments to your HTML page using the following syntax.
< ! - - **write your comment here** - - >  

 + **There** is an exclamation mark in the opening tag that will not be in the closing tag.
Comments are not displayed by the browser, but they can help document your HTML.
With comments, you can place notifications and reminders in your HTML.

**Example:**
1.<-- I am a girl -->    
2.<p>I love to write articles..</p    
**3.<!-- Remember to add more information here -->**

## so whats abou how , what and why structurs :

+ **what** a HTML element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable ..the /*<artical>*/is really brilliant.

+ **why** -object element is only supported in Internet Explorer (from the major browsers)) elements.

+ **Why** attribute values should always be quoted in HTML .
